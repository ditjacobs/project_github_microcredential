**When to use git and Github: illustrated with examples**

## Collaboration ##
For example:
* Conflict resolving individually 
* Experimenting risk free in different branches 
* Developing a pipeline together 

How:
By adding collaborators to a repo on Github. They can either clone the repo locally or fork the repo. 
1. When cloning locally, changes can be added, commited, and pushed to Github. Other collaborators can pull the changes. 
Furthermore, they can work in separate branches, to work individually and merge all work together in the end. 
2. When a repo is forked, changes can be made but will only be edited in the original repo once a pull request is accepted 

## Version Control for personal projects ##

In project, software is often updated. However, a pipeline needs to be adapted accordingly to the version changes and you want to keep the previously working pipeline. Git is useful to track all of these versions.  

## Tracking changes in a paper ##

When making a paper, you can track all edits/changes using git and github.
